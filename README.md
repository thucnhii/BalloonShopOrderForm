# Bonnie's Balloon Shop Order Form
## Introduction
This is an assignment that I use Visual C# to create a form.
## Business Scenario
*Bonnie's Balloons* is a small privately-owned balloon shop operated by Bonnie Leiter,
who employees a small staff of assistants, including delivery personnel. The shop 
specializes in high-quality Mylar ballons decorated for special occassions. The 
price of a balloon order depends on the size of the balloons bundle, what types 
of "extras" are included with the order (e.g., flowers, candy, etc.), whether a 
message card is included, and whether the customer picks up the order at the shop 
or has it delieverd to them. Balloon orders are predominantly taken by phone, although 
there are some walk-in customers. Bonnie is interested in converting the current paper-based order-taking 
system into an automated one.
